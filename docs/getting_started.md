# Getting Started

End-to-end guide for the AI Capstone imitation-learning pipeline: generating synthetic demonstrations in simulation, then training and evaluating a robot manipulation policy.

## Overview

This project builds imitation-learning policies for robot manipulation tasks (cup stacking, cutlery arrangement, toy blocks collection). The pipeline has four stages:

1. **Simulate** — generate synthetic training data in Isaac Lab with preconfigured domain randomization
2. **Train** a policy model with LeRobot
3. **Evaluate** the trained policy in the simulator (rollout)
4. **Verify and diagnose** whether the dataset covers the conditions needed by the task

## Where to run what

| Stage | Environment | Why |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Simulation (datagen + rollout) | GlowsAI | Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab / Vulkan stack pinned in image |
| Training (`lerobot-train`) | GlowsAI | Docker adds I/O overhead — train natively for throughput |

> **GlowsAI VNC terminal:** When using the VNC desktop terminal on GlowsAI, switch to the `glows` user first:
> ```bash
> su - glows
> ```

For details on the repo layout and developer setup, see [Developer Introduction](dev/introduction.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11** — required by the project (pinned in `.python-version`)
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — Python package manager used for this workspace
- **Git** — with submodule support
- **Docker + Docker Compose** — required for simulation steps (Isaac Lab runs in a container)
- **Linux machine with Nvidia GPU + driver** — required for simulation and training. Verify with `nvidia-smi`.
- **Hugging Face account** — datasets and model checkpoints are stored on the Hub. Create a token at <https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens>.

> **No local GPU?** Training and simulation require a Linux machine with an Nvidia GPU.
> See [Cloud GPU Setup with GlowsAI](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xPHm3gNNvLbX7aOWnY_xW5dfVLEa9XiBuskMbRsgxI8/edit?usp=sharing) for instructions on using cloud GPU instances.

### Installing prerequisites

```bash
# Docker
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# Add your user to the docker group (avoids needing sudo for docker commands)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

Verify installations:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

## Installation

```bash
# Initialize submodules (required before Docker build)
make submodules

# Install all Python dependencies
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate

# Build and launch the Isaac Lab container (simulation, datagen, rollout)
# Pick the target matching your GlowsAI GPU:
make launch-isaaclab-glowsai-4090   # RTX 4090
make launch-isaaclab-glowsai-l40s   # L40S
```

### Hugging Face login

```bash
hf auth login --token <YOUR_HF_TOKEN>
export HF_USER=<your-huggingface-username>
```

Set `HF_USER` each terminal session — commands throughout this project reference it.

---

## Step 1: Generate Synthetic Data in Simulation

> **Run on: GPU machine, inside Docker container.** Requires Linux + Nvidia GPU + Docker (see Prerequisites).

### Launch the Isaac Lab container

Pick the target matching your GlowsAI GPU:

| Target | GPU |
|--------|-----|
| `make launch-isaaclab-glowsai-4090` | RTX 4090 (VNC display :1) |
| `make launch-isaaclab-glowsai-l40s` | L40S (VNC display :1) |

```bash
# GlowsAI — pick one:
make launch-isaaclab-glowsai-4090
make launch-isaaclab-glowsai-l40s
```

All remaining commands in this step run **inside the container**.

### Run data generation

Each task ships with preconfigured domain randomization: object poses are re-randomized at every environment reset, so no recorded pose file is needed. `--num_demos` sets the number of randomized episodes to run, and `--use_lerobot_recorder` saves the result in [LeRobot dataset format](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/main/en/lerobot-dataset-v3#format-design). Only successful episodes are exported.

Available tasks:
- `HCIS-CupStacking-SingleArm-v0`
- `HCIS-CutleryArrangement-SingleArm-v0`
- `HCIS-ToyBlocksCollection-SingleArm-v0`

```bash
python scripts/datagen/generate.py \
    --task HCIS-CupStacking-SingleArm-v0 \
    --num_envs 1 \
    --device cuda \
    --enable_cameras \
    --record \
    --use_lerobot_recorder \
    --lerobot_dataset_repo_id ${HF_USER}/<repo_id> \
    --num_demos 20
```

The dataset lands in `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/${HF_USER}/<repo_id>/`.

### Upload the generated dataset

```bash
hf upload ${HF_USER}/<repo_id> ./datasets/${HF_USER}/<repo_id>/
```

For the full data generation pipeline reference, see [Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline](synthetic_data_generation.md).

---

## Step 2: Train a Policy

> **Run on: GPU machine, host (not inside Docker).

It uses your uploaded dataset from Step 1 and produces a trained policy checkpoint.

**Quick start:**

```bash
uv sync && source .venv/bin/activate

lerobot-train \
  --dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/<repo_id> \
  --policy.type=diffusion \
  --output_dir=<your-output-dir> \
  --job_name=cupstacking \
  --policy.device=cuda \
  --wandb.enable=true \
  --policy.repo_id=${HF_USER}/my_policy
```

Training takes a few hours to over a day depending on dataset size and GPU.

For the complete flag reference, multi-GPU training, troubleshooting, and upload instructions, see [LeRobot Training Procedure](lerobot_training.md).

---

## Step 3: Evaluate in Simulation (Rollout)

> **Run on: GPU machine, inside Docker container.** Same Isaac Lab environment as Step 1.

Loads your trained policy and runs it in the simulator to evaluate performance.

```bash
# Inside the container
python scripts/rollout.py \
    --task=<eval_task_file> \
    --policy_type=lerobot-<policy_name> \
    --policy_checkpoint_path=<path/to/checkpoint> \
    --policy_action_horizon=1 \
    --device=cuda \
    --enable_cameras \
    --eval_rounds=<num_rounds> \
    --episode_length_s=20
```

Placeholders:

| Placeholder | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `<eval_task_file>` | Path to an evaluation task file under `eval/` (see table below) |
| `<policy_name>` | LeRobot policy variant — e.g. `diffusion`, `act`, `pi0` (full flag becomes `lerobot-diffusion`, etc.) |
| `<path/to/checkpoint>` | Local path to the trained policy checkpoint directory |
| `<num_rounds>` | Number of evaluation episodes to roll out |

Pick `--task` from the evaluation task files under `eval/`:

| Task | Eval file |
|------|-----------|
| Cup stacking | `eval/cup_stacking_eval.py` |
| Cutlery arrangement | `eval/cutlery_arrangement_eval.py` |
| Toy blocks collection | `eval/toy_blocks_collection_eval` |

For the full procedure including model download and flag reference, see [LeRobot Rollout (Policy Evaluation)](lerobot_rollout.md).

---

## Step 4: Data Verification — Why Did the Policy Fail?

A failed rollout does not automatically mean that the model architecture or training strategy is the
problem. Instead, first inspect whether the training dataset covers the conditions that
appeared during evaluation. To help user verify their collected data, we provide **object-pose coverage** 
as a complete example from Star-Gen taxonomy. It records each object's pose in the [LeRobot v3 dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/main/en/lerobot-dataset-v3#format-design), describes the coverage
requirement in RDF/OWL, and uses SHACL to report which spatial cells have too few
episodes. Follow [Object Pose Coverage](object_pose_coverage.md) to record the
required columns, write a Turtle specification, and run the checker.

Coverage is a diagnostic, not proof of the cause: an uncovered evaluation region
is evidence of a possible data-distribution gap, while complete coverage does not
guarantee that a policy will succeed.

If your hypothesis concerns a different factor, you can also select it from Star-Gen taxonomy, and follow
[Adding a New Dataset Coverage Factor](adding_coverage_factor.md). It explains the
full extension path from recording a LeRobot feature through RDF graph mapping,
OWL vocabulary, SHACL counting rules, reports, and tests.
